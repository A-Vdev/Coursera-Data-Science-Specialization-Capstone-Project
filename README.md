# Word Prediction Application
### Abhijeet

## Discription
The Word Prediction App, a product of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) Capstone Course by Johns Hopkins University, emerges from a collaboration with SwiftKey to tackle the inconvenience of mobile typing. SwiftKey's expertise in smart keyboard technology, featuring predictive text models, sets the foundation for this project.

The capstone project recognizes the evolving landscape of data science and the significance of natural language processing (NLP) in addressing contemporary challenges, especially in the realm of mobile interactions. While providing resources for exploration, it encourages participants to leverage their existing knowledge to create impactful and user-friendly data products. Overall, the initiative emphasizes adaptability, creativity, and the application of learned skills to novel contexts in the dynamic field of data science.
